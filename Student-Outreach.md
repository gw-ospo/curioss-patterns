# Student Outreach

# Pattern Summary

Learn strategies for student outreach with social media engagement, tabling events, workshops, movie nights, and hiring student ambassadors to support the open source program office and engage with a wide array of students from across the university.

# Problem

The Open Source Program Offices in university settings aim to educate, support and provide tools for students and researchers about the open source software and tools. It can be challenging for new OSPOs to connect with students. Many students don't know what open source is and many student might not be familiar with how it can be relevant to them. It can be hard for staff and faculty to communicate with students to educate and engage them regarding the various services and initiatives that are available for their benefit.

# Pattern Category

- Outreach
- Community building
- Education & Skills
- Student Engagement

# Context

A university with an established OSPO interested in student outreach.

# Forces

- Many university campuses do not have outreach methods to students beyond email, which does not offer personalized engagement.
- Limited engagement or interest from students.
- Students may not have knowledge of the existing Open Source Program Office at their university.
- The OSPO team hopes to meaningfully engage with students and foster a university culture of collaboration and sharing.

# Solution

Here are some outreach approaches to increasing engagement with the open source community targeted at students:

1. Hire Student Ambassadors

To better understand students' needs and interests, you need to have access to the student perspective. The best way to achieve this is to hire student ambassadors who are familiar with open source and community building. Student Ambassadors can educate their fellow students in peer-to-peer interactions, with approaches that are personalized and less intimidating than information heavy emails or lectures. To learn more about student ambassadors, you can read [GW OSPO Student Ambassador Program](https://github.com/CURIOSSorg/curioss-patterns/blob/main/Student-Ambassadors.md).

2. Create Social Media accounts

To connect with and notify students about events, workshops, resources, and programming, having a community on popular social media platforms is the most efficient and effective method. Instagram is a popular social media choice among students to interact with organizations and each other. Through Instagram posts, stories, and by following student organizations, you can increase engagement and reach a larger audience. LinkedIn is another social media platform that students use to connect with professionals and discover opportunities. Creating a LinkedIn account to connect with other open source organizations or offices while having collaborative events can help students learn about professional opportunities in the open source world.

3. Host tabling event

Hosting a table at events either independently or in collaboration with other student organizations is an effective method of connecting with students easily. Engage in interactive activities to educate them about relevant open source content. Host this tabling event at a central location on campus and use it as an opportunity to share the services your Open Source Program Office offers. To learn more about hosting tabling events, you can read [Event Tabling](https://github.com/CURIOSSorg/curioss-patterns/blob/main/event-tabling.md).

4. Organize workshops

Organize a first contribution open source workshop where students can engage with the OSPO office with a simple activity like uploading an image that can be displayed in an animated art gallery website. Workshops are a great introduction to open source and demonstrate fundamentals in an interactive and informative way.

5. Host movie nights

Host movie screening events where students can relax and learn about open source. Screening movies like "The Internet's Own Boy," a documentary about Aaron Swartz, can inspire conversation about building community and collaborations.

# Resulting Context

The most effective ways to reach students include hiring student ambassadors, creating social media content, hosting tabling events, organizing workshops, hosting movie nights and many more. These methods are easily applicable to OSPO offices across different universities and highlight programs offered by your Open Source Program Office in a fun and interactive way. The goal is to reach as many students as possible and provide them a better understanding of your OSPO.

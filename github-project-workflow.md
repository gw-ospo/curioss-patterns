# Github Projects For OSPO Workflow

# Pattern Summary

Utilizing Github Projects as a centralized workflow system to organize and manage OSPO tasks.

# Problem / Challenge

Academic OSPOs often manage and plan a multitude of events, workshops, consultations, and training. In addition to managing tools, resources, and repositories. Without a shared and open-source workflow system, information can be scattered and disorganized. OSPOs need clear, transparent, and open ways of managing and organizing work. 

# Pattern Category
- Community Building
- Education & Skills
- Open Source Development
- Open Source Discovery
- Promoting Best Practices
- Tools & Infrastructure
   
# Context
This pattern applies to university-based OSPOs that use GitHub as a primary collaboration platform and coordinate work across multiple contributors, such as staff, faculty, and student workers. It is especially relevant for OSPOs managing recurring activities across academic terms, including events, training, consultations, and open source projects.

# Forces
+ **Transparency vs. sensitivity:** OSPOs aim to work openly, but some tasks involve sensitive information (students, contracts) that cannot be fully public.
+ **Learning curve:** GitHub Projects requires contributors to learn and follow a structured workflow, which can be challenging in academic OSPOs where students and short-term contributors rotate frequently.
+ **Timely updates:** Project boards are only useful if issues are consistently updated, which can be difficult to maintain alongside daily OSPO work.
+ **Tracking sub-issues:** Many OSPO tasks involve dependencies and subtasks, which can be difficult to represent clearly without added structure.
+ **Tool integration gaps:** Limited integration with tools like Slack, Gmail, or Logseq can cause work to be discussed or tracked outside GitHub, reducing visibility.

# Solution

Adopt GitHub Projects as the OSPO’s centralized, shared workflow system and integrate it into all active projects and repositories. Use it as the default place to plan, track, and discuss OSPO work.

+ **Centralized and transparent tracking:**
Use an organization-level project board to make all OSPO work visible, allowing team members to see, comment on, and follow progress without requiring work to be “perfect” or closed immediately.

+ **Consistent team usage:**
Program coordinators and technical team members use the project regularly to plan, update, and coordinate work, establishing shared habits and accountability.

+ **Onboarding and collaboration:**
Label “good first issues” to support student onboarding and enable external collaborators to participate in discussions and task tracking.

+ **Simplified planning and reporting:**
Project views, milestones, and iterations provide a lightweight way to track progress across semesters and generate reports without additional tools.

### Key steps include:

1. **Create a single organization-level GitHub Project:**
Use one shared project board as the central place to track all OSPO activities across repositories, teams, and semesters.

2. **Standardize work intake using GitHub Issues:**
Represent tasks as issues and link them to the project board, ensuring required fields and context are captured consistently.

3. **Structure work with labels, milestones, and iterations:**
Apply labels for work type and priority, use milestones for major deliverables, and iterations to align work with academic terms.

4. **Streamline managment of multiple repositories:**
Github enables issues from any repository to be managed within any project. 

6. **Support onboarding and collaboration:**
Use “good first issue” labels to onboard new contributors and enable both internal and external collaborators to participate openly.


# Resulting Context

The OSPO gains a clear and collaborative picture of ongoing work across all teams and repositories. Staff can easily report progress and plan across semesters. 

A potential trade-off is that contributors unfamiliar with GitHub Projects may need additional training at the start.

# Github Projects For OSPO Workflow

# Pattern Summary

Utilizing Github Projects as a centralized workflow system to organize and manage OSPO tasks

# Problem / Challenge

Academic OSPOs often manage and plan a multitude of events, workshops, consultations, and training. In addition to managing tools, resources, and repositories. Without a shared and open-source workflow system, information can be scattered and disorganized. OSPOs need clear, transparent, and open ways of managing and organizing work. 

# Pattern Category
- Community Building
- Education & Skills
- Open Source Development
- Open Source Discovery
- Promoting Best Practices
- Tools & Infrastructure
   
# Context
This pattern can apply to most university-based OSPO's, most specifically ones that use Github as a collaboration platform, and would need to manage work amongst several contributors/members. 

# Forces



# Solution

(Thinking of adding more details here)

Adopt GitHub Projects as the OSPO’s centralized workflow system and integrate it into all active projects.

### Key steps include:

1. Creating an organization-level GitHub Project board to track all OSPO work.

2. Using GitHub Issues for tasks and linking them directly to the project board.

3. Applying labels, milestones, and assignments to prioritize and organize work.

4. Using built-in automation so issues and pull requests update the board automatically.


# Resulting Context

The OSPO gains a clear and collaborative picture of ongoing work across all teams and repositories. Staff can easily report progress and plan across semesters. 

A potential trade-off is that contributors unfamiliar with GitHub Projects may need additional training at the start.

# Event Tabling 

# Pattern Summary 

Learn how to run a tabling event with games, interactive open source activities and prizes to engage students across the university. 

 # Problem 

Open Source programming is aimed at fostering collaboration - especially at university OSPOs. However, it can be challenging to meaningfully engage with busy students, faculty, and staff who work across diverse disciplines and are unaware of how the OSPO can benefit their work.

 # Pattern Category

* Awareness
* Community building
* Education & Skills
* Open Source Discovery 

# Context

A university with an established OSPO interested in student engagement.

# Forces

* OSPO teams want to meaningfully engage and foster a university culture of collaboration and sharing.
* Potential stakeholders have not been exposed to open source and have not engaged with the OSPO office.
* There has been limited engagement with broader audiences due to resource and staffing limitations.

# Solution

Host an 'Open Source' or OSPO table at a wider campus event to connect with students, faculty and staff and to promote the OSPO. 

## Preparation

The following tasks may be worth considering:
* Practice a brief pitch for those who have never heard of open source and the OSPO office.
* Have OSPO merch, candy or other goodies available.
* Create and make accessible flyers or a scannable QR with more information about your OSPO so interested individuals know where to look to continue their engagement with your OSPO office. 

## Interactive Activities and Conversation Starters

Feature interactive activities that offer a brief introduction to open source. Activities may demonstrate to students that they have used open sources platforms, and the power of sharing work in the open. The two activities below serve as useful examples:

* **Open Source vs. Proprietary Matching Game (Activity 1):** Visitors match company logos, platforms and apps and guess which are open-source models and which are closed-source. This activity highlights how open source models are a part of daily life, even when people may not realize it. 
Open source platforms to include: R, Drupal, WordPress, Linux, Python, Open Street Map, React, Bluesky, Docker, Gimp, Android and Jupyter.
Proprietary platforms to include ChatGPT, Gmail, Facebook, TikTok, X, GitHub, Slack, Adobe, WhatsApp, MailChimp.

* **Open Source Art Contribution (Activity 2):** Provide students with an opportunity to showcase their creativity by creating artwork and participating in their first open source contribution on GitHub. Allow participants to draw something on a piece of paper. Staff demonstrate to students how to upload their artwork to GitHub (or any open source repository). Students then see their artworks uploaded live as a part of a collaborative open source art collection. 

# Resulting Context

Tabling is an effective way to briefly introduce the OSPO to the wider campus community in an informal and meaningful way. 

## Additional Learning from the GW Open Source Program Office
The George Washington University Open Source Program Office tabled at a [makerspace event hosted by a student-run organization GeorgeHacks](https://ospo.gwu.edu/georgehacks-makerspace-2025). 

The GW OSPO Student Ambassadors tabled the event and were able to meaningfully connect with students, advertise their upcoming events, and increase open source awareness with students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds.

The [open source art repository](https://github.com/gw-ospo/open-source-workshop) was a great success with students seeing their masterpices uploaded live as part of a [collaborative open source art collection](https://gw-ospo.github.io/open-source-workshop/).

This event was a fantastic opportunity to meet so many members of our community, answer questions about open source and share information about our upcoming programming.

# Event Tabling 

# Pattern Summary 

Learn how to run a tabling event with games, interactive open source activities, and prizes to engage students across the university. 

 # Problem 

Open Source programming is aimed at fostering collaboration, especially at university OSPOs, students are the majority of this community. It can be challenging to meaningfully engage students, faculty, and staff across disciplines and share the OSPO mission. It can be hard to entice a broad range of individuals across campus to come to events or use OSPO resources without educating them on what open source means and building a network through meaningful engagement. Community members also have limited time, and often interest, in something they may have never heard of. The OSPO may also have limited time or resources to engage in outreach with such a broad audience. It is important to engage learners in an effective, engaging, and practical way. Only by involving members from across the community and getting them excited about open source can our mission of open collaboration become authentic.

 # Pattern Category

* Outreach
* Community building
* Open Source Discovery 
* Education & Skills
* Building University OSS Community

# Context

A university with an established OSPO interested in student engagement.

# Forces

 * Many members across university campuses have not been exposed to open source and are not engaged with the OSPO office
* Limited methods of practical, in-person, effective outreach 
* Limited engagement with broader audiences because of resource and staffing limitations
* University community members, with busy schedules, may not want to engage with the OSPO if they are unaware of open source
* OSPO teams want to meaningfully engage and foster a university culture of collaboration and sharing. 

# Solution

Host a table at an event, like the GW Makerspace event, either independently or in partnership with other campus organizations in the heart of campus. Connect with students, faculty, and staff to share information about open source and the OSPO. Practice a brief pitch for those who have never heard of open source, both about the concept and the OSPO office. Reward participants for their participation with OSPO merch, candy, or other goodies. Create and make accessible flyers or a scannable QR with more information about your OSPO so interested individuals know where to look to continue their engagement with your OSPO office. 

## Feature two interactive activities once you give students a brief introduction to open source: 

* Open Source vs. Proprietary Matching Game (Activity 1): Visitors matched logos of different companies, platforms, and apps—ranging from Python to TikTok—and guessed which ones use open-source models and which are closed-source. This activity highlighted how often open source models are a part of daily life, even when people may not realize it. This activity inspired some great conversations about the importance of open source and how it impacts society. Open source platforms to include (R, Drupal, WordPress, Linux, Python, Open Street Map, React, Bluesky, Docker, Gimp, Android, Jupyter). Proprietary platforms to include (ChatGPT, Gmail, Facebook, TikTok, X, GitHub, Slack, Adobe, WhatsApp, MailChimp)
* Open Source Art Contribution (Activity 2): Provide students with an opportunity to showcase their creativity by creating artwork and participating in their first open source contribution on GitHub. Allow participants to draw something on a piece of paper and submit their work to our [open source art repository](https://github.com/gw-ospo/open-source-workshop). Staff will demonstrate to students how to upload their artwork to GitHub. Walk them through the process and watch them see their masterpieces uploaded live as part of a [collaborative open source art collection](https://gw-ospo.github.io/open-source-workshop/).
These activities demonstrate to students that they used open sources platforms, and the power of sharing their work through open source. 

# Resulting Context: 

Tabling is an effective way to briefly introduce the OSPO to your campus community in an informal yet meaningful way. With this program you will advertise OSPO resources in an appealing way, connect open source to their fields and interests, and demonstrate the value of open source in an interactive way. The goal of tabling is to  have people walk away gaining a better understanding of open source and your OSPO. This event was a fantastic opportunity to meet so many members of our community, answer questions about open source, and share information about our upcoming programming.

# Known Instances

* [The George Washington University](https://ospo.gwu.edu/georgehacks-makerspace-2025): The George Washington University Open Source Program Office tabled at a makerspace event hosted by a student-run organization GeorgeHacks. The GW OSPO Student Ambassadors tabled the event and were able to meaningfully connect with students, advertise their upcoming events, and increase open source awareness with students from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds.

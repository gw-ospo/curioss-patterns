# OSPO Website

# Pattern Summary

Establish a website for an Academic Open Source Program Office (OSPO) to communicate its mission, activities, and opportunities. The website serves as the central public interface for stakeholders within the institution and beyond.

# Problem / Challenge

Open source work in academia is usually dispersed across departments, labs, and projects - making it difficult for academic OSPOs to directly communicate with and reach all stakeholders.

Without a transparent, discoverable web presence:
* The OSPO becomes dependent on personal networks to promote its services and activities. 
* Potential collaborators will not easily find or understand what the OSPO does.
* A wider pool of students and researchers may miss opportunities to participate in open source initiatives.

As a result, the OSPO risks invisibility and its potential impact is limited.

# Pattern Category

- Awareness
- Community Building
- Demonstrating value as an OSPO
   
# Context

A research institution or a university creating large volumes of research outputs across every discipline.

An OSPO has been established.

# Forces

OSPO staff members have the resources/capacity to create a website and update content on a regular basis.

# Solution

Develop and maintain a dedicated OSPO website as the public-facing hub for all OSPO-related information and engagement.

## Planning and Design

The list below covers broad areas of tasks to be considered during the planning and design phase:

* **Liaise with relevant colleagues** in the communications and IT teams to understand institutional requirements for digital branding and/or selection of website platforms.

* **Define the website’s core purpose** and its primary goals - e.g., awareness, collaboration, resource sharing and/or impact reporting.

* Establish **clear information architecture** for website content.

* **Plan for sustainability** - assign content ownership and agree on a standard process for content updates, technical maintenance, and community feedback loops.

## Website Content

Based on the website’s goals, content may cover the following themes:

* **About the OSPO:** Its mission, vision, governance, and team.

* **OSPO Services:** Support and capacity building activities provided by the OSPO. 

* **Projects and Collaboration:** Promotion of active open source projects (e.g. project registry), student programs, internal and external partnerships.

* **Highlight Impact:** Metrics, stories and case studies demonstrating the OSPO’s impact on research, education, and open source communities.

* **Events and News:** Workshops, hackathons, and community highlights.

* **Get Involved:** Opportunities for students, researchers, and partners to engage with the OSPO.

* **Funding page:** A dedicated page with information on how to sponsor or donate to the OSPO.

* **Resources:** A collection of relevant policies, toolkits and best practices for stakeholders.

## Other areas for consideration:

One question to consider may be whether to make the site itself open source.

# Resulting Context

The OSPO website becomes a central point of discovery and engagement for stakeholders within and outside of its institution. 

Students, researchers and faculty engaged in open source activity benefit from:
* A central hub of up to date information signposting relevant services and opportunities.
* Lower barriers to internal and external collaboration.

The OSPO itself benefits from:
* Enhanced institutional visibility and legitimacy of open source work.
* A platform that consistently communicates its mission and outputs.
* A public archive of its projects, policies, and impact.
* A platform for further open source discovery through an open source registry, open source survey, a newsletter and slack channels.

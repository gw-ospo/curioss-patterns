# Maintainers & Contributors Roundtable

# Pattern Summary

Convene a community of practice consisting of students and staff who are actively maintaining or contributing to university open source software projects in the research enterprise.

# Problem / Challenge

Active open source software maintainers and contributors are often scattered across laboratories and departments on university campuses. In many cases, maintainers find themselves in isolated roles without a way of learning about each otherâ€™s work or a means of connecting. A certain proportion of maintainers are experts in their research field but not in open sources software development and lack the awareness of where and how to find the information they need.

# Pattern Category

- Open Source Discovery
- Promoting Best Practices
   
# Context

A research university creates large volumes of research outputs across every discipline.

A university wishes to convene a community of practice comprising of developers, maintainers, coding leads, and similar stakeholders of open source software projects to facilitate the sharing of project activity, best practices, and pain points, and promote engagement of technical team members with the OSPO.

A Research Software Engineer (RSE) or equivalent group does not currently exist (or lacks visibility) on campus.

# Forces

There is a growing or established interest in creating a community space for maintainers or contributors to open source software.

Students and staff who are actively maintaining or contributing to university open source software projects but want to connect with peers in similar roles or do not know where to access advice.

An OSPO or community lead with capacity to plan monthly meetings.

An OSPO that wishes to learn about the project activity and technical painpoints directly from maintainers and contributors.

# Resulting Context

*What are the outcomes of applying this pattern?*

Creating a dedicated on-campus space for open source software maintainers and contributors fosters an essential sense of community, effectively alleviating the isolation many have previously experienced in their roles. This newfound connection encourages the sharing of knowledge, skills, and experiences. Encouraging developers, coding leads, research scientists, and similar stakeholders to build relationships with each other also instills a supportive network that can lead to collective problem-solving, particularly if members are willing to seek feedback on specific aspects of their project. Moreover, hosting this community of practice can strengthen the relationships between the members and the OSPO, enabling the OSPO to engage members on other OSPO inititaves (e.g. workshops, consultations, mentorship).

A particularly valuable result is that members continue to stay in touch outside of monthly meetings. Having a dedicated communication channel (e.g. dedicated Slack channel, mailing list) for members to continue to share ideas, solicit advice, and build connection has made the monthly meeting cadence feel appropriate since there are many asynchronous touchpoints between meetings. 

In line with our aim to create a safe space for members, we do not invite faculty PI's to monthly meetings, unless there is a special session and we notify members in advance. We based this on a simple idea that people behave differently when the "boss" is in the room, and we received positive feedback from membesr about this choice. However, there is possibility for convening an alternative community of practice that allows faculty members in the case where the faculty member IS the maintainer of the project and would find valuable learning from a community of other project maintainers.

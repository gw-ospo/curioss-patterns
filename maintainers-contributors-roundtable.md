# Maintainers & Contributors Roundtable

# Pattern Summary

Convene a community of practice consisting of students and staff who are actively maintaining or contributing to university open source software projects in the research enterprise.

# Problem / Challenge

Active open source software maintainers and contributors are often scattered across laboratories and departments on university campuses. In many cases, maintainers find themselves in isolated roles without a way of learning about each otherâ€™s work or a means of connecting. A certain proportion of maintainers are experts in their research field but not in open sources software development and lack the awareness of where and how to find the information they need.

# Pattern Category

- Community Building
- Education & Skills
- Open Source Discovery
- Promoting Best Practices
   
# Context

A research university creates large volumes of research outputs across every discipline.

A university wishes to convene a community of practice comprising of developers, maintainers, coding leads, and similar stakeholders of open source software projects to facilitate the sharing of project activity, best practices, and pain points, and promote engagement of technical team members with the OSPO.

A Research Software Engineer (RSE) or equivalent group does not currently exist (or lacks visibility) on campus.

# Forces

There is a growing or established interest in creating a community space for maintainers or contributors to open source software.

Students and staff who are actively maintaining or contributing to university open source software projects but want to connect with peers in similar roles or do not know where to access advice.

An OSPO or community lead with capacity to plan monthly meetings.

An OSPO that wishes to learn about the project activity and technical painpoints directly from maintainers and contributors.

# Solution

*How does this pattern resolve the problem?*  
Provide a detailed description of the solution. Include actionable steps or guidance for implementing the solution.

* How did you identify there was a need?
* How did you advertise it or promote it?
* How did you decide on the format?
* How do you run them?

# Resulting Context

*What are the outcomes of applying this pattern?*

Describe both the intended positive results and any potential side effects or consequences.

* People have a space to meet and connect, and share knowledge - not isolated anymore
* Opportunity to build relationships with each other
* Build relationships with the OSPO

(Additional learning - no faculty members in M&CR)
Talk of a possible faculty space e.g. when faculty member IS the maintainer of the project

(useful insight: make a beginner-friendly format separate from Maintainers)
